# 🏭 Manufacturing Agent - Industrial Manufacturing

## Overview
The Manufacturing Agent specializes in governance, risk, and compliance operations for the Industrial Manufacturing sector. It handles quality management, safety compliance, and supply chain risk management specific to manufacturing operations.

## Key Capabilities

### Regulatory Compliance
- **ISO 9001**: Quality management system, continuous improvement, customer focus
- **ISO 14001**: Environmental management system, environmental policy, legal compliance
- **OSHA**: Safety programs, hazard communication, lockout/tagout, PPE requirements
- **EPA**: Environmental permits, emissions monitoring, waste management
- **RoHS/REACH**: Substance restrictions, material declaration, testing requirements

### Risk Management
- **Safety Risk**: Workplace accidents, machine injuries, chemical exposure
- **Quality Risk**: Product defects, customer complaints, regulatory non-compliance
- **Environmental Risk**: Air emissions, water discharge, chemical spills
- **Supply Chain Risk**: Supplier failure, raw material shortages, transportation disruption
- **Operational Risk**: Equipment failure, production delays, energy outages

### Key Performance Indicators
- Defect Rate: <1%
- Customer Satisfaction: >4.0/5
- First Pass Yield: >95%
- Lost Time Injuries: 0
- Equipment Uptime: >95%
- Production Efficiency: >90%

## Usage Example
```python
from manufacturing_agent.manufacturing_grc_agent import ManufacturingGRCAgent

# Initialize Manufacturing agent
agent = ManufacturingGRCAgent()

# Perform safety risk assessment
risk_result = await agent.perform_grc_operation(
    GRCOperationType.RISK_ASSESSMENT,
    {"business_unit": "production_floor", "risk_scope": "safety"}
)

# Check ISO 9001 compliance
compliance_result = await agent.perform_grc_operation(
    GRCOperationType.COMPLIANCE_CHECK,
    {"framework": "ISO 9001", "business_unit": "quality_management"}
)
```
