# üè• Healthcare Agent - Healthcare & Life Sciences

## Overview
The Healthcare Agent specializes in governance, risk, and compliance operations for the Healthcare and Life Sciences sector. It handles patient safety, regulatory compliance, and clinical risk management specific to healthcare organizations.

## Key Capabilities

### Regulatory Compliance
- **HIPAA**: Privacy rule, security rule, breach notification, business associate agreements
- **Joint Commission**: Patient safety goals, medication management, infection prevention

- **FDA**: Good clinical practice, adverse event reporting, clinical trial compliance
- **CLIA**: Laboratory standards, quality control, proficiency testing

### Risk Management
- **Patient Safety Risk**: Medication errors, surgical errors, healthcare-associated infections
- **Clinical Risk**: Adverse drug events, medical device failures, diagnostic errors
- **Regulatory Risk**: FDA violations, HIPAA breaches, CMS penalties
- **Operational Risk**: Staff shortages, equipment failures, system downtime
- **Privacy Risk**: Data breaches, unauthorized access, consent management

### Key Performance Indicators
