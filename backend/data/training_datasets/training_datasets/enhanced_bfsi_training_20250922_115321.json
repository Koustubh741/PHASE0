    "input": "BFSI: Expanded Audit, Compliance & Policy \nInventory with References  \nAudit Points & Checklist (Expanded)  \nGovernance & Risk Management:  BFSI institutions require strong corporate \ngovernance and risk frameworks. Boards set the strategy, objectives, and risk appetite, \nand senior management executes them. Effective governance “identifies the authorities \nand responsibilities of the board and senior management” and is “essential to the safe \nand sound operation of the bank” [1]. Risk governance applies these principles to \nidentify, measure, monitor and control risks enterprise -wide[2]. Audit checklists verify \nthat governance structures (e.g. ri sk committees, audit committees) are in place, that \nroles (board, CRO, compliance officers) are defined, and that strategic decisions align \nwith approved risk appetite.  \nRegulatory Compliance:  Maintaining compliance with laws and regulations is critical. \nCompliance risk is defined as the risk to financial condition “arising from violations of \nlaws or regulations, or from nonconformance with prescribed practices” [3]. Banks \nimplement compliance programs addressing requirements (e.g. licensing, KYC/ AML, \nreporting, consumer protection) to mitigate this risk. Checklists confirm adherence to \napplicable laws, such as central bank regulations or industry standards. Rigorous \ndocumentation (e.g. regulatory filings, reporting logs) and regular reviews help e nsure \nno violations occur. Compliance points include testing adherence to regulations like \nbanking laws or anti -bribery statutes, with audit trails for all regulatory submissions.  \nInternal Audit & Controls:  BFSI entities rely on layered controls. Internal audit is a key \nassurance function: it provides independent review of controls, risk management, \nfinancial reporting and governance processes. According to supervisory guidance, \ninternal audit “provides assurance to the board and senior management… on the q uality \nof the bank’s internal controls” and on risk management and financial reporting [4]. \nChecklists include confirmation of an independent internal audit department and Audit \nCommittee oversight. Audits typically verify that control procedures are documented and \ntested (e.g. transaction authorizations, reconciliations) and that any control failures lead \nto corrective action. The board and management are responsible for an effective system \nof internal controls and audit, as noted by regulators [5]. \nAML & Financial Crime:  Banks must combat money laundering a nd financial crime \nthrough robust AML/CFT controls. Internationally, the FATF Recommendations provide \na framework for AML/CTF programs [6]. Audit points include verifying that customer due \ndiligence (KYC) processes are followed (identification, verification, beneficial owner \nchecks) and that transaction monit oring and suspicious activity reporting are \noperational. Institutions ensure their AML policies align with FATF standards (as \nimplemented in law) to screen for illicit activities. Compliance checklists test controls like \ncurrency transaction report filing,  customer risk rating, and employee training on AML \nrules. Strong AML controls protect the bank and the financial system from abuse by \ncriminals and terrorists.  \nInformation Security & Cybersecurity:  Audit checklists cover protection of data and \nIT systems.  Banks should follow standards such as ISO/IEC 27001 for an Information \nSecurity Management System [7]. Points include verifying security controls (firewalls , \nencryption, access controls), incident response plans, and regular penetration testing. \nRegulatory requirements (e.g. the US Gramm -Leach -Bliley Act) mandate that financial \ninstitutions maintain “administrative, technical and physical safeguards for sensi tive \ncustomer information” [8]. Audits examine whether se curity policies exist, that network \nand application security tests are performed, and that any security incidents are logged \nand addressed. Cybersecurity points also include disaster recovery tests for critical \nsystems.  \n \nCompliance Checklist (Expanded)  \nLicensing & Supervision:  Banks and insurance companies must obtain and maintain \nregulatory licenses before they can operate. Proper licensing (from a central bank or \ncharter authority) is required, as the banking industry “requires special licensing to \nopera te”[9]. Institutions then register with one or more regulatory agencies (e.g. central \nbank, securities  regulator) for ongoing supervision. Supervisors review periodic reports \nand may conduct examinations to ensure rules are followed [10]. Compliance checklists \nverify that all required licenses, registrations, and renewals are current and documented \n(for example, banking licenses, insurance certifications, or broker -dealer registrations).  \nRegulatory Framework & Governance:  Institutions must codify regulations into \ninternal frameworks. This starts with enterprise risk assessments to identify inherent \nand operational risks [11]. Senior management and the board must “get buy -in and \nguidance” for compliance programs, establishing a tone -at-the-top and clear \naccountability for compliance [12]. Written policies and procedures are developed and \ncommunicated to staff [13]. Compliance checklists confirm that documented procedures \nexist for all major regulatory requirements, that governance structures (e.g. compliance \ncommittees) are active, and that management reviews and approves the compliance \nframework annually. This ensures employees know their compliance obligations and \nauditors can trace how rules are implemented.  \nCapital Adequacy & Risk Management:  Checklists ensure prudential requirements \nare met. Banks must maintain minimum  capital ratios to absorb losses, as defined by \nstandards like Basel III [14]. They also must hold sufficient liquid res erves and often \ncarry deposit insurance for customer protection [15]. Checklist items include verifying \nthat capital a dequacy and liquidity ratios are calculated correctly, reviewing capital \nplanning processes, and ensuring compliance with regulatory capital directives (e.g. \ntimely submission of capital reports). Credit risk limits, concentration limits, and capital \nbuffe rs are checked for compliance with regulations. In insurance, solvency margins \nand reserve requirements are similarly verified.  \nFinancial Reporting & Disclosure:  Banks must produce accurate, timely financial \nstatements and disclosures. They file regular re ports with regulators (e.g. securities \nregulators, central banks) and adhere to accounting standards (IFRS/GAAP). U.S. \nregulations like the Sarbanes -Oxley Act mandate strong controls over financial \nreporting [16]. Checklists include auditing the general ledger, verifying that independent \nauditors have approved the statements, and ensuring disclosures (e .g. risk factors, \ncapital structure) meet legal requirements. The goal is transparency: customers and \ninvestors should have a clear view of the bank’s financial condition and risk profile, so \nthe checklist also covers review of public filings (annual repor ts) and compliance with \ndisclosure laws.  \nData Privacy & Protection:  With rapid data flows, banks must protect customer \ninformation and privacy. Compliance programs address both. For example, the U.S. \nTruth in Savings Act requires clear disclosure of accoun t terms and fees to \ncustomers [17], and data privacy laws (e.g. the Gramm -Leach -Bliley Act or GDPR) \nrequire robu st safeguards for personal data [8]. Checklists verify co ntrols like data \nencryption, access restrictions, and breach response processes. Auditors ensure \nprivacy policies are followed: for instance, no sensitive customer data is exposed or \nshared improperly. Customer consent records, data retention schedules, an d secure \ndisposal of data are audited to prevent information leaks and ensure regulatory \ncompliance.  \nOutsourcing & Vendor Management:  Banks often outsource non -core functions, but \nmust manage vendor risk carefully. Checklists verify a formal vendor managem ent \npolicy, including vendor approval and ongoing oversight. This includes due diligence \nakin to KYC: verifying a vendor’s credentials, beneficial owners, and background [18]. \nContracts with third parties must include clauses requiring vendors to meet the bank’s \nregulatory standards (for example, data protection and audit rights) [19]. Audits confirm \nthat only approved vendors are used and that their performance (and compliance \nprograms) is reviewed regularly. This en sures outsourced activities meet the same \ncompliance requirements as in -house operations and do not introduce unmonitored risk.  \nTraining & Awareness:  Compliance culture depends on employee understanding. \nChecklists include ensuring that staff training prog rams are in place. All employees \nshould receive regulatory compliance training on topics like AML, cyber -security, and \nethics, starting at onboarding and refreshed periodically [20][21]. Checklists verify that \ntraining content is up -to-date wit h current laws, that attendance is documented, and that \nemployees have passed any compliance tests. For example, evidence of annual anti -\nfraud training or periodic cybersecurity drills is collected. Well -trained staff are a first line \nof defense against co mpliance lapses, so regulatory audits often check training records \nas part of compliance monitoring.  \n \nPolicy Inventory (Expanded)  \nCorporate Governance Policy:  Documents board and leadership structure, \ncommittees, and oversight functions. It formalizes gov ernance practices consistent with \nregulatory principles. For example, U.S. guidance notes that corporate governance \n“identifies the authorities and responsibilities of the board and senior management” and \nis “essential to the safe and sound operation” of a  bank [1]. This policy outlines how the \nboard sets strategy and risk appetite, supervises management, and enforces \naccountability. It typically references national laws (e.g. the Banking Regulation Act or \ncorporate governance codes) and enumerate s required board committees (audit, risk, \nnominations).  \nRisk Management Policy:  Defines how the bank identifies and addresses credit, \nmarket, liquidity, operational and other risks. Consistent with global standards, banks \nmaintain an independent risk manag ement function led by a Chief Risk Officer [22]. The \npolicy sets risk limits, assessment processes and governance (e.g. reporting lines to the \nboard). It aligns with Basel Committee principles, ensuring risk identification, \nmeasurement, and mitigation procedures are documented. The policy also addresses \nenterprise risk management (ERM) frameworks, specifyin g how stress tests and risk \nappetite statements are developed and approved.  \nCode of Conduct & Ethics Policy:  Sets standards of behavior and conflict -of-interest \nrules for all personnel. It covers confidentiality, fair dealing, anti -corruption, and \ncomplian ce with laws. U.S. regulators emphasize that a code of conduct should “provide \nemployees, officers, directors and agents with specific guidelines on acceptable and \nunacceptable business practices” [23]. This policy typically incorporates legal \nrequirements (e.g. prohibitions of insider trading or acceptance of gifts) and establishes \nmechanisms for reporting violations. The FDIC guidance also recommends requiring all \nemployees to sign an acknowledgment of the code and training them on any \nupdates [24]. \nAML/KYC Policy:  Specifies customer due diligence (CDD) and anti -money laundering \nprocedures. It implements FATF recommendations [6] and relevant laws by defining \nKYC steps (identity v erification, beneficial owner checks) and CDD for high -risk clients. \nThe policy describes transaction monitoring rules, recordkeeping requirements and \nreporting of suspicious transactions. It ensures compliance with AML/CFT laws (such as \nfiling Currency Tr ansaction Reports) and may include screening against sanctions lists. \nBy inventorying data requirements and retention schedules, it also aligns with privacy \nsafeguards for personal data.  \nInformation Security Policy:  Governs protection of digital assets and  IT systems. \nBased on ISO/IEC 27001 (the global information security standard [7]), it establishes \ncontrols to maintain confidentiality, integrity and availa bility of data. The policy defines \nroles (e.g. a Chief Information Security Officer), outlines technical and administrative \nsafeguards, and mandates regular security assessments. It addresses network security, \ndata encryption, access controls and incident response procedures. This policy \nsupports regulatory requirements (for example, GLBA’s mandate for data safeguards [8]) \nand ensures auditability of security events.  \nData Privacy Policy:  Addresses customer and employee personal data protection. It \nensures compliance with privacy laws (e.g. GDPR in Europe or secto r-specific rules) by \ndefining how data is collected, used and shared. For example, the policy will include \nprovisions required by GLBA/Privacy Rules for non -disclosure of customer \ninformation [8]. It specifies consent processes, data retention and disposal rules, and \nbreach notification procedures. By cataloguin g all personal data held by the institution, \nthe policy supports transparency to customers and readiness for data protection audits \nor assessments.  \nBusiness Continuity & Resilience Policy:  Outlines plans to maintain operations \nduring disruptions. It follow s international standards (ISO 22301) by requiring \nidentification of critical functions, business impact analysis, and recovery strategies [25]. \nThe policy mandates development and testing of business continuity plans (BCPs) and \ndisaster recovery plans (DRPs), including backup sites a nd data recovery procedures. It \nalso assigns crisis management roles and communication protocols. Regulators expect \nproof of regular BCP testing and updates; thus the policy includes obligations to review \nand revise plans after each test or real incident.  \nVendor/Outsourcing Policy:  Manages third -party and outsourcing risks. It requires \ndue diligence on vendors’ credentials and compliance posture (akin to a “Know Your \nBusiness” vetting) [18]. The policy ensures contracts include regulatory obligations (data \nprotection, audit rights, performance metrics). It also mandates ongoing monitoring of \nvendor risk, including period ic audits or certifications. By maintaining a complete \ninventory of outsourced services and associated documents, this policy helps ensure \nthat critical activities remain under the bank’s risk management and that outsourcing \ndoes not evade regulatory overs ight[19]. \n \n[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Corporate and Risk Governance, Comptroller's Handbook  \nhttps://www.occ.treas.gov/publications -and-resources/publications/comptrollers -\nhandbook/files /corporate -risk-governance/pub -ch-corporate -risk.pdf  \n[6] The FATF Recommendations  \nhttps://www.fatf -gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Fatf -\nrecommendations.html  \n[7] ISO/IEC 27001:2022 - Information security management systems  \nhttps://www.iso.org/standard/27001  \n[8] [23] [24] Microsoft Word - code of conduct fil.doc  \nhttps://www.fdic.gov/news/financial -institution -letters/2005/fil10 505.pdf  \n[9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] 2024 Compliance Checklist: \nYour Guide to Banking Regulations - Blog | Unit21  \nhttps://www.unit21.ai/blog/banking -regulatory -compliance -checklist  \n[22] Corporate governance principles for banks  \nhttps://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d328.pdf  \n[25] ISO 22301 - Business Continuity Management | BSI  \nhttps://www.bsigroup.com/en -US/products -and-services/standards/iso -22301 -business -\ncontinuity -management/",

Internal audit is a key \nassurance function: it provides independent review of controls, risk management, \nfinancial reporting and governance processes. According to supervisory guidance, \ninternal audit “provides assurance to the board and senior management… on the q uality \nof the bank’s internal controls” and on risk management and financial reporting [4]. \nChecklists include confirmation of an independent internal audit department and Audit \nCommittee oversight. Audits typically verify that control procedures are documented and \ntested (e.g. transaction authorizations, reconciliations) and that any control failures lead \nto corrective action. The board and management are responsible for an effective system \nof internal controls and audit, as noted by regulators [5]. \nAML & Financial Crime:  Banks must combat money laundering a nd financial crime \nthrough robust AML/CFT controls. Internationally, the FATF Recommendations provide \na framework for AML/CTF programs [6]. Audit points include verifying that customer due \ndiligence (KYC) processes are followed (identification, verification, beneficial owner \nchecks) and that transaction monit oring and suspicious activity reporting are \noperational. Institutions ensure their AML policies align with FATF standards (as \nimplemented in law) to screen for illicit activities. Compliance checklists test controls like \ncurrency transaction report filing,  customer risk rating, and employee training on AML \nrules. Strong AML controls protect the bank and the financial system from abuse by \ncriminals and terrorists.  \nInformation Security & Cybersecurity:  Audit checklists cover protection of data and \nIT systems.  Banks should follow standards such as ISO/IEC 27001 for an Information \nSecurity Management System [7]. Points include verifying security controls (firewalls , \nencryption, access controls), incident response plans, and regular penetration testing. \nRegulatory requirements (e.g. the US Gramm -Leach -Bliley Act) mandate that financial \ninstitutions maintain “administrative, technical and physical safeguards for sensi tive \ncustomer information” [8]. Audits examine whether se curity policies exist, that network \nand application security tests are performed, and that any security incidents are logged \nand addressed. Cybersecurity points also include disaster recovery tests for critical \nsystems.  \n \nCompliance Checklist (Expanded)  \nLicensing & Supervision:  Banks and insurance companies must obtain and maintain \nregulatory licenses before they can operate. Proper licensing (from a central bank or \ncharter authority) is required, as the banking industry “requires special licensing to \nopera te”[9]. Institutions then register with one or more regulatory agencies (e.g. central \nbank, securities  regulator) for ongoing supervision. Supervisors review periodic reports \nand may conduct examinations to ensure rules are followed [10]. Compliance checklists \nverify that all required licenses, registrations, and renewals are current and documented \n(for example, banking licenses, insurance certifications, or broker -dealer registrations).  \nRegulatory Framework & Governance:  Institutions must codify regulations into \ninternal frameworks. This starts with enterprise risk assessments to identify inherent \nand operational risks [11]. Senior management and the board must “get buy -in and \nguidance” for compliance programs, establishing a tone -at-the-top and clear \naccountability for compliance [12]. Written policies and procedures are developed and \ncommunicated to staff [13]. Compliance checklists confirm that documented procedures \nexist for all major regulatory requirements, that governance structures (e.g. compliance \ncommittees) are active, and that management reviews and approves the compliance \nframework annually. This ensures employees know their compliance obligations and \nauditors can trace how rules are implemented.  \nCapital Adequacy & Risk Management:  Checklists ensure prudential requirements \nare met. Banks must maintain minimum  capital ratios to absorb losses, as defined by \nstandards like Basel III [14]. They also must hold sufficient liquid res erves and often \ncarry deposit insurance for customer protection [15]. Checklist items include verifying \nthat capital a dequacy and liquidity ratios are calculated correctly, reviewing capital \nplanning processes, and ensuring compliance with regulatory capital directives (e.g. \ntimely submission of capital reports). Credit risk limits, concentration limits, and capital \nbuffe rs are checked for compliance with regulations. In insurance, solvency margins \nand reserve requirements are similarly verified.  \nFinancial Reporting & Disclosure:  Banks must produce accurate, timely financial \nstatements and disclosures. They file regular re ports with regulators (e.g. securities \nregulators, central banks) and adhere to accounting standards (IFRS/GAAP). U.S. \nregulations like the Sarbanes -Oxley Act mandate strong controls over financial \nreporting [16]. Checklists include auditing the general ledger, verifying that independent \nauditors have approved the statements, and ensuring disclosures (e .g. risk factors, \ncapital structure) meet legal requirements. The goal is transparency: customers and \ninvestors should have a clear view of the bank’s financial condition and risk profile, so \nthe checklist also covers review of public filings (annual repor ts) and compliance with \ndisclosure laws.  \nData Privacy & Protection:  With rapid data flows, banks must protect customer \ninformation and privacy. Compliance programs address both. For example, the U.S. \nTruth in Savings Act requires clear disclosure of accoun t terms and fees to \ncustomers [17], and data privacy laws (e.g. the Gramm -Leach -Bliley Act or GDPR) \nrequire robu st safeguards for personal data [8]. Checklists verify co ntrols like data \nencryption, access restrictions, and breach response processes. Auditors ensure \nprivacy policies are followed: for instance, no sensitive customer data is exposed or \nshared improperly. Customer consent records, data retention schedules, an d secure \ndisposal of data are audited to prevent information leaks and ensure regulatory \ncompliance.  \nOutsourcing & Vendor Management:  Banks often outsource non -core functions, but \nmust manage vendor risk carefully. Checklists verify a formal vendor managem ent \npolicy, including vendor approval and ongoing oversight. This includes due diligence \nakin to KYC: verifying a vendor’s credentials, beneficial owners, and background [18]. \nContracts with third parties must include clauses requiring vendors to meet the bank’s \nregulatory standards (for example, data protection and audit rights) [19]. Audits confirm \nthat only approved vendors are used and that their performance (and compliance \nprograms) is reviewed regularly. This en sures outsourced activities meet the same \ncompliance requirements as in -house operations and do not introduce unmonitored risk.  \nTraining & Awareness:  Compliance culture depends on employee understanding. \nChecklists include ensuring that staff training prog rams are in place. All employees \nshould receive regulatory compliance training on topics like AML, cyber -security, and \nethics, starting at onboarding and refreshed periodically [20][21]. Checklists verify that \ntraining content is up -to-date wit h current laws, that attendance is documented, and that \nemployees have passed any compliance tests. For example, evidence of annual anti -\nfraud training or periodic cybersecurity drills is collected. Well -trained staff are a first line \nof defense against co mpliance lapses, so regulatory audits often check training records \nas part of compliance monitoring.  \n \nPolicy Inventory (Expanded)  \nCorporate Governance Policy:  Documents board and leadership structure, \ncommittees, and oversight functions. It formalizes gov ernance practices consistent with \nregulatory principles. For example, U.S. guidance notes that corporate governance \n“identifies the authorities and responsibilities of the board and senior management” and \nis “essential to the safe and sound operation” of a  bank [1]. This policy outlines how the \nboard sets strategy and risk appetite, supervises management, and enforces \naccountability. It typically references national laws (e.g. the Banking Regulation Act or \ncorporate governance codes) and enumerate s required board committees (audit, risk, \nnominations).  \nRisk Management Policy:  Defines how the bank identifies and addresses credit, \nmarket, liquidity, operational and other risks. Consistent with global standards, banks \nmaintain an independent risk manag ement function led by a Chief Risk Officer [22]. The \npolicy sets risk limits, assessment processes and governance (e.g. reporting lines to the \nboard). It aligns with Basel Committee principles, ensuring risk identification, \nmeasurement, and mitigation procedures are documented. The policy also addresses \nenterprise risk management (ERM) frameworks, specifyin g how stress tests and risk \nappetite statements are developed and approved.  \nCode of Conduct & Ethics Policy:  Sets standards of behavior and conflict -of-interest \nrules for all personnel. It covers confidentiality, fair dealing, anti -corruption, and \ncomplian ce with laws. U.S. regulators emphasize that a code of conduct should “provide \nemployees, officers, directors and agents with specific guidelines on acceptable and \nunacceptable business practices” [23]. This policy typically incorporates legal \nrequirements (e.g. prohibitions of insider trading or acceptance of gifts) and establishes \nmechanisms for reporting violations. The FDIC guidance also recommends requiring all \nemployees to sign an acknowledgment of the code and training them on any \nupdates [24]. \nAML/KYC Policy:  Specifies customer due diligence (CDD) and anti -money laundering \nprocedures. It implements FATF recommendations [6] and relevant laws by defining \nKYC steps (identity v erification, beneficial owner checks) and CDD for high -risk clients. \nThe policy describes transaction monitoring rules, recordkeeping requirements and \nreporting of suspicious transactions. It ensures compliance with AML/CFT laws (such as \nfiling Currency Tr ansaction Reports) and may include screening against sanctions lists. \nBy inventorying data requirements and retention schedules, it also aligns with privacy \nsafeguards for personal data.  \nInformation Security Policy:  Governs protection of digital assets and  IT systems. \nBased on ISO/IEC 27001 (the global information security standard [7]), it establishes \ncontrols to maintain confidentiality, integrity and availa bility of data. The policy defines \nroles (e.g. a Chief Information Security Officer), outlines technical and administrative \nsafeguards, and mandates regular security assessments. It addresses network security, \ndata encryption, access controls and incident response procedures. This policy \nsupports regulatory requirements (for example, GLBA’s mandate for data safeguards [8]) \nand ensures auditability of security events.  \nData Privacy Policy:  Addresses customer and employee personal data protection. It \nensures compliance with privacy laws (e.g. GDPR in Europe or secto r-specific rules) by \ndefining how data is collected, used and shared. For example, the policy will include \nprovisions required by GLBA/Privacy Rules for non -disclosure of customer \ninformation [8]. It specifies consent processes, data retention and disposal rules, and \nbreach notification procedures. By cataloguin g all personal data held by the institution, \nthe policy supports transparency to customers and readiness for data protection audits \nor assessments.  \nBusiness Continuity & Resilience Policy:  Outlines plans to maintain operations \nduring disruptions. It follow s international standards (ISO 22301) by requiring \nidentification of critical functions, business impact analysis, and recovery strategies [25]. \nThe policy mandates development and testing of business continuity plans (BCPs) and \ndisaster recovery plans (DRPs), including backup sites a nd data recovery procedures. It \nalso assigns crisis management roles and communication protocols. Regulators expect \nproof of regular BCP testing and updates; thus the policy includes obligations to review \nand revise plans after each test or real incident.  \nVendor/Outsourcing Policy:  Manages third -party and outsourcing risks. It requires \ndue diligence on vendors’ credentials and compliance posture (akin to a “Know Your \nBusiness” vetting) [18]. The policy ensures contracts include regulatory obligations (data \nprotection, audit rights, performance metrics). It also mandates ongoing monitoring of \nvendor risk, including period ic audits or certifications. By maintaining a complete \ninventory of outsourced services and associated documents, this policy helps ensure \nthat critical activities remain under the bank’s risk management and that outsourcing \ndoes not evade regulatory overs ight[19]. \n \n[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Corporate and Risk Governance, Comptroller's Handbook  \nhttps://www.occ.treas.gov/publications -and-resources/publications/comptrollers -\nhandbook/files /corporate -risk-governance/pub -ch-corporate -risk.pdf  \n[6] The FATF Recommendations  \nhttps://www.fatf -gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Fatf -\nrecommendations.html  \n[7] ISO/IEC 27001:2022 - Information security management systems  \nhttps://www.iso.org/standard/27001  \n[8] [23] [24] Microsoft Word - code of conduct fil.doc  \nhttps://www.fdic.gov/news/financial -institution -letters/2005/fil10 505.pdf  \n[9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] 2024 Compliance Checklist: \nYour Guide to Banking Regulations - Blog | Unit21  \nhttps://www.unit21.ai/blog/banking -regulatory -compliance -checklist  \n[22] Corporate governance principles for banks  \nhttps://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d328.pdf  \n[25] ISO 22301 - Business Continuity Management | BSI  \nhttps://www.bsigroup.com/en -US/products -and-services/standards/iso -22301 -business -\ncontinuity -management/",
