# BFSI API Security Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security implementation for the Real-Time BFSI API, designed to meet PCI-DSS and GDPR compliance requirements for financial services.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

#### JWT/OAuth2 Authentication
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Token Expiration**: Configurable access token (30 min) and refresh token (7 days)
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with salt for secure password storage
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permissions system

#### User Roles & Permissions
```python
# Available Roles
- admin: Full system access
- compliance_officer: Compliance and audit access
- risk_manager: Risk assessment and transaction access
- data_analyst: Analytics and metrics access
- auditor: Read-only audit access
- readonly: Limited read access
```

#### Permission System
```python
# Permission Examples
- read:all - Read access to all data
- write:transactions - Create/update transactions
- write:compliance - Compliance operations
- read:audit_logs - Audit log access
- write:encryption - Encryption operations
```

### 2. Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection

#### Sliding Window Rate Limiting
- **Requests per minute**: 100 (configurable)
- **Burst limit**: 20 requests per second
- **IP-based tracking**: Per-client rate limiting
- **Automatic cleanup**: Old requests removed from memory

#### Implementation
```python
# Rate limiting middleware
app.add_middleware(RateLimitMiddleware)

# Configuration
rate_limit_requests_per_minute: int = 100
rate_limit_burst: int = 20
```

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization

#### Pydantic Validation
- **Strict type checking**: All inputs validated against schemas
- **Size limits**: Request payload size restrictions
- **Format validation**: Regex patterns for sensitive fields
- **XSS prevention**: Script injection detection and blocking

#### Validation Examples
```python
class SecureTransactionRequest(BaseModel):
    amount: float = Field(..., ge=0.01, le=1000000)
    customer_id: str = Field(..., min_length=1, max_length=50)
    transaction_type: str = Field(..., regex="^(debit|credit|transfer|payment)$")
```

### 4. Data Encryption

#### Encryption at Rest
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM
- **Key Management**: Secure key generation and rotation
- **Sensitive Fields**: Customer IDs, account numbers, card data
- **Database Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted before storage

#### Encryption in Transit
- **TLS 1.3**: All communications encrypted
- **Certificate Management**: Automated certificate rotation
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Ephemeral key exchange

#### Implementation
```python
# Encryption manager
encryption_manager = EncryptionManager()

# Encrypt sensitive data
encrypted_data = encryption_manager.encrypt(sensitive_data)

# Decrypt for authorized access
decrypted_data = encryption_manager.decrypt(encrypted_data)
```

### 5. Audit Logging

#### Comprehensive Logging
- **Data Access**: All database operations logged
- **User Actions**: Authentication and authorization events
- **System Events**: Processing status and errors
- **Compliance Events**: PCI-DSS and GDPR activities

#### Audit Log Format
```json
{
    "timestamp": "2024-01-20T10:30:00Z",
    "operation": "SELECT",
    "table": "transactions",
    "user_id": "admin_001",
    "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
    "details": {"limit": 50, "filters": {}}
}
```

#### Log Retention
- **Retention Period**: 7 years (BFSI compliance)
- **Encryption**: Audit logs encrypted at rest
- **Integrity**: Cryptographic hashing for tamper detection

### 6. Security Headers

#### HTTP Security Headers
```http
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

#### CORS Configuration
```python
# Restricted CORS origins
allow_origins=["https://localhost:3000", "https://localhost:8080"]
allow_methods=["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"]
```

### 7. Database Security

#### Connection Pooling
- **Pool Size**: 10 connections (configurable)
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds connection timeout
- **Thread Safety**: Thread-safe connection management
- **Resource Cleanup**: Automatic connection cleanup

#### Secure Data Access
```python
# Repository pattern with security controls
class SecureDataRepository:
    def get_transactions(self, user_id: str, filters: Dict):
        # Encrypt/decrypt sensitive data
        # Log all access
        # Apply user permissions
        pass
```
